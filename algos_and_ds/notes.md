# Algorithms and Data Structures

Based on: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hly31xKli0&t

## Intro

- Algorithm: Set of steps/instructions for completing a task

  - Set of steps a program takes to finish a task

### Why learn algorithms?

1. When we talk about algorithms, we mean that there's a body of knowledge on how to solve some computational problems well
2. Understanding when to apply algorithms is as important as knowing their existence

- The most important part of DSA
- We should be able to break a problem down and identify which DSA are best placed for it
- Algorithm thinking
  - Break a complex problem into a smaller unit and be able to compose a solution to this smaller problem

3. Understanding efficiency/computational demand, both in time and space

### Algorithmic Thinking

- Clearly define what the problem set is
- Clarify what values count as inputs
- There's not a "best" solution, instead we should think what solution works better for the current problem
