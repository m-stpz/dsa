1. Define an invariant: Statement that is ALWAYS TRUE after each iteration
   - It describes the state of the system, not the actions
   - The algorithm's purpose becomes maintaining that truth as it processes each element

Ex: After each iteration, all elements before index back (inclusive) are unique and in sorted order

## Algorithmic thinking

1. Define invariants early

   - What must always be true after each iteration? => Compass

2. Know state transitions
   - Every algorithm mutates state (variables, data structures)
   - Be explicit:
     - What is the state before a step?
     - What changes during step?
     - What's guaranteed after the step?
